## Development

```

This will start the Vite development server for React and also launch your custom backend server.

## Folder Structure

- `/frontend`: Contains all frontend files, including React components, styles, and assets.
- `/backend`: Contains all backend files, including server logic, API routes, and database configurations.
- `/public`: Public files accessible from the root URL, such as HTML templates and static assets.
- `/src`: Source files for both frontend and backend, organized into respective directories.

## Customization

- **Frontend**: You can modify the React components, styles, and scripts in the `/frontend` directory to customize the frontend of your application.
- **Backend**: Customize the backend logic, API routes, and database configurations in the `/backend` directory to suit your project requirements.

## Deployment

To deploy your application, you can build the frontend using Vite's build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then deploy the built files along with your backend server to your preferred hosting provider.

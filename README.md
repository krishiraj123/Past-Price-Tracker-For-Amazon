Sure, here's a basic README.md file for your project using React with Vite and a custom server:

```markdown
# React Vite Project with Custom Server

## Introduction

This project is a template for building React applications using Vite for fast development and a custom server setup for backend operations. It allows you to quickly scaffold a project with modern tooling and a flexible backend architecture.

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server for both the frontend (React) and backend (custom server), run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server for React and also launch your custom backend server.

## Folder Structure

- `/frontend`: Contains all frontend files, including React components, styles, and assets.
- `/backend`: Contains all backend files, including server logic, API routes, and database configurations.
- `/public`: Public files accessible from the root URL, such as HTML templates and static assets.
- `/src`: Source files for both frontend and backend, organized into respective directories.

## Customization

- **Frontend**: You can modify the React components, styles, and scripts in the `/frontend` directory to customize the frontend of your application.
- **Backend**: Customize the backend logic, API routes, and database configurations in the `/backend` directory to suit your project requirements.

## Deployment

To deploy your application, you can build the frontend using Vite's build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then deploy the built files along with your backend server to your preferred hosting provider.
